  <p>As can be seen above non seasonal issues such as the wellness check serve as a baseline and are fairly even from month to month, while traditionally seasonal health issues such as the flu are most apparent in its traditional seasonal range, however it is interesting that the the later part of the traditonal flu season range (october to april peaking in december to february). According to this data all UTI cases appear in January and March so UTI prevention and awareness programs rolled out in late december early January and in late Februarary early March may be effective.</p>
